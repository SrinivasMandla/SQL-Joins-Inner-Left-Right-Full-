Task 5: SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)
ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal of this task is to learn how to combine data from multiple related tables using SQL JOINs. This helps in analyzing and retrieving meaningful information spread across different tables.

ðŸ›  Tools

DB Browser for SQLite

MySQL Workbench

ðŸ“‚ Task Description

Create two related tables (e.g., Customers and Orders).

Establish a relationship between them using a primary key â€“ foreign key connection.

Practice the following types of JOINs:

INNER JOIN â†’ Returns only matching rows from both tables.

LEFT JOIN â†’ Returns all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table.

RIGHT JOIN â†’ Returns all rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table.

FULL OUTER JOIN â†’ Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.

ðŸ”— Learning Outcomes

Understand how to merge data from multiple tables.

Gain practical experience with different JOIN operations.

Learn how JOINs handle matching and non-matching records.

Build confidence in writing SQL queries that combine relational data.

âœ… Outcome

By the end of this task, you will have mastered:

INNER JOIN for precise matches.

LEFT JOIN to include unmatched records from the left side.

RIGHT JOIN to include unmatched records from the right side.

FULL JOIN (or equivalent simulation in SQLite) to combine everything.
